        <h1>Our Other Teams</h1>
    </header>
    <p>We have many teams in other FIRST leagues that spread the same message of promoting STEM to our youth.</p>
    <h2>(R)Evolution 17070</h2>
    <p>(R)Evolution was a team initiative that began in September 2024. This team was established to help our Evolution FTC (<i>FIRST Tech Challenge</i>) teams by presenting how a team properly prototypes, solves problems, communicate and organize to build the best robot possible. We also present how to apply for awards, program their robot in java, and how to bring their concepts to life.</p>
