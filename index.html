    <h1>What is Evolution 2626?</h1>
    <p class="main-text">Evolution 2626 is the first francophone FIRST Robotics Competition Team (FRC) based in Sherbrooke, Quebec. We are also spreading robotics throughout the Eastern Townships. We are FRC Team Evolution 2626, proudly representing the SÃ©minaire de Sherbrooke in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Every year, we participate in the famous FIRST Robotics Competition. Since our humble beginnings in 2008, we have evolved into a cooperative of dreamers and achievers. On this website, you will find information on our team, on the FIRST program and resources for other FRC teams. Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. We are 69 members strong. This website documents our journey, our path and our discoveries throughout the years in the STEM field.</p>
