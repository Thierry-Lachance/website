    <h1>What is Evolution 2626?</h1>
    <p>Evolution 2626 is the First francophone First Robotics Competition Team (FRC) based in Sherbrooke, Quebec. We are also spreading robotics throughout the Eastern Townships. </p>
    <p>We are FRC Team Evolution 2626, proudly representing the SÃ©minaire de Sherbrooke in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Every year, we participate in the famous FIRST Robotics Competition. Since our humble beginnings in 2008, we have evolved into a cooperative of dreamers and achievers.

    <p>Our mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>
